<h1>Color Settings</h1>

<h2><a name="default">Default Colors</a></h2>
The default colors can be seen in the legend on the right side of the model view.<br><br>

<h3>Default appearance</h3>

<h3>Referenced Element</h3>
If the name of a class appears as red and italic, a selected element references this class. Additionally, a red exclamation mark
appears by the name of the class of the selected element. This indicates that the class contains a dangling reference.<br><br>

<h3>Dangling Reference</h3>
A dangling reference is displayed with a red background behind the name of the class. This shows, that an Element has been selected, 
but not its super class.<br><br>

<h3>Reference with mandatory target</h3>
A red "M" symbol by the name of the element indicates that it has a lower bound of at least one and needs to be referenced.<br><br>

<h3>Constraint</h3>
The "C" Symbol indicates that the element has at least one constraint.<br><br>

<h3>Override</h3>
"Override" written in grey next to an element shows that the element is defined by a super class and can be 
overwritten by a subclass.<br><br>
