This meta model was created with the UML 2.4 meta model as a base.
From that on all elements which were not essential for a state machine were removed
(even Events and ValueSpecifications, Expressions and some Behavior)
This meta model should function as a reduced, effective meta model for MagicDraw UML Statecharts.
