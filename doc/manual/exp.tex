\subsection{Matching Engine}

\plugin{org.sidiff.correspondences}{org.sidiff.correspondences.extensionpoint}{none}{TODO}

\plugin{org.sidiff.candidates}{org.sidiff.candidates.extensionpoint}{none}{TODO}

\plugin{org.sidiff.matcher}{org.sidiff.matcher.extensionpoint}{none}{
This extension point is used to add new matchers. A plugin that adds this extension point has to implement the IMatcher interface.
}\label{exp:org.sidiff.matcher.extensionpoint}

\plugin{org.sidiff.similarities}{org.sidiff.similarities.extensionpoint}{none}{TODO}

\subsection{Difference Derivator}

\plugin{org.sidiff.difference.technical}{org.sidiff.difference.technical.technical\_difference\_builder\_extension}{none}{
This extension point is used to add a technical difference builder to the lifting engine. A plugin that adds this extension point has to implement the ITechnicalDifferenceBuilder interface. This interface offers the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item The document type the technical difference builder was implemented for.
\end{itemize}
}\label{exp:org.sidiff.difference.technical.extensionpoint}

\subsection{Lifting Engine}
\plugin{org.sidiff.difference.rulebase}{org.sidiff.difference.rulebase.rulebase\_extension}{org.eclipse.emf.ecore.generated\_package}{
This extension point is used to add new rulebases to the recognition engine. A plugin that adds this extension point had to implement the IRuleBase interface. This interface offers the following information to the recognition engine:
\begin{itemize}
\item A description name of the rulebase.
\item The document type the rulebase was generated for. In other words, the meta model the edit rules were implemented for.
\item A list containing all rulebase recognition rules which will be applied by the recognition engine.
\end{itemize}
