Model transformation technologies have reached a high
level of maturity.
 They are nowadays used beyond the traditional purpose of
model transformation in model-driven engineering, where
transformations were manually designed.
 In some new applications, transformation rules
cannot be manually designed for two reasons: the 
transformation rules become very large, the effort to 
manually construct them ist too high, and they rules 
must be generated on the fly.
 One example of such a new type of transformation
occurs in the context of modell differencing: 
 Model comparison algorithms initially deliver low-level
model differences; these low-level differences must be
semantically lifted into representations of user-level
edit operations.
 The necessary transformation rules can be automatically
derived from rule-based implementations of the
corresponding edit operations.
 This paper describes our approach of generating
recognitions rules, which are the core of the semantic
lifting of low-level differences, from edit rules.
 We also describe experinces with our implementation on
the basis of EMF Henshin.
