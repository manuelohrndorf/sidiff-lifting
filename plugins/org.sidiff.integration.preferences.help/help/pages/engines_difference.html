		<h1>Difference</h1>
		<p> Based on a given set of <i>correspondences</i>, a difference is built by a <b>Technical Difference Builder</b>. 
		The difference basically consists of</p>
		<ul>
			<li>model elements that are deleted and created,</li>
   	 		<li>model references that are deleted and created,</li>
    		<li>and changed values of attributes of model elements.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A Technical Difference Builder can exclude predefined element, reference and attribute types from the difference.
		For instance, SiLift already provides several Technical Difference Builder for Ecore excluding <code>EAnnotations</code> or <code>EGenericTypes</code>.</p>
		<p>Further Technical Difference Builder can be added via the <i>extension point</i> <code>technical_difference_builder_extension</code>.</p>
