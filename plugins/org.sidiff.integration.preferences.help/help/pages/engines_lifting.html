		<h1>Lifting</h1>
		<p>The lifting engine identifies groups of low-level changes representing the effect of a high-level edit operation.
		Therefore, a set of language specific high-level edit operations must be implemented as EMF Henshin model transformation rules.</p> 
		<p>The set of edit operations must be provided as a Rule-Base Project via the <i>extension point</i> <code>org.sidiff.editrule.rulebase.project.runtime.extension</code>.</p>
