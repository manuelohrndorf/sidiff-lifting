		<h1>Matching</h1>
		<p>A <b>Matcher</b> searches for pairs of <i>corresponding</i> model elements which are considered to be the same in both models.</p>
		<p>SiLift comes with a set of primitive <i>generic</i> matchers such as a UUID matcher based on XMI-IDs and a simple, but efficient signature-based matcher which establishes correspondences based on equal values of name attributes;
		these names are available for the most model element types in typical modeling languages.</p>
		<p> Furthermore, SiLift can be adapted to arbitrary more sophisticated <i>generic</i> or <i>domain specific</i> matching engines.
		For instance, an adapter for EMF Compare has already been realized. For Ecore models a ID-based matcher based on Ecore-IDs is available.</p>
		<p>Further Matcher can be added via the <i>extension point</i> <code>org.sidiff.matcher.extensionpoint</code>.</p>
